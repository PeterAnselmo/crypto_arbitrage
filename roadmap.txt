To-Do:
-handle case of recovering streams from bad data
-inspect with valgrind. seems to slow down after running a while.
-cleanup tests, update to use multi output

Optimization Ideas:
-Convert JSON decode of WS ticker to custom string tokenization function (can even start at ",[" and stop after bid/ask)
--Did this, only a few microseconds faster :-(
-Test different WS libraries. Can cpprest be removed and just use libwebsockets?
-Change currency strings to be ints (with lookup populated by GET returnTicker)
