To-Do:
-Compare computed amounts to market depths. Shuffle if insufficient depth at any.
--Implemented, needs more test coverage
--Improve code - omit uneeded sell amoutn param (just set next sell), replace with position
-handle case of recovering streams from bad data
-inspect with valgrind. seems to slow down after running a while.
-cleanup tests, update to use currency streams

Optimization Ideas:
-Test different WS libraries. Can cpprest be removed and just use libwebsockets?
-Change currency strings to be ints (with lookup populated by GET returnTicker)
