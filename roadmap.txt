To-Do:
-Pre-compute amounts of all trades. Skip if below .00001
--can then combine poloniex_sell() & poloniex_buy() 
--will assist later with parallizing them)

Optimization Ideas:
-Convert JSON decode of WS ticker to custom string tokenization function (can even start at ",[" and stop after bid/ask)
-Test different WS libraries. Can cpprest be removed and just use libwebsockets?
-Send trade request in parallele with curl_multi.
--Could then remove specification to be immediate (pros & cons to this)
-Change currency strings to be ints (with lookup populated by GET returnTicker)
-Skip output of balances before trade (will be at log) - Output after trade
